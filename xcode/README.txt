A vague attempt at getting into development on iOS since that seems to be what the hip kids do these days.

The only project here is a port of my simple guessing game app for Android. 

I don't think iOS development is for me, but this is proof that I'm willing to learn any skillset, no matter how much of a non-fan of the workflow I am.
